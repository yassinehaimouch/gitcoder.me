Frontend development is a broad field, but developers often fall into two distinct categories based on their approach and understanding of the technology. Let’s dive into these two types of frontend developers and explore the key differences.

### 1. The Implementer

The first type of frontend developer views their role primarily as taking designs from platforms like Figma and translating them into code using popular JavaScript libraries or frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. This developer focuses on implementing the visual aspects of a project, making sure that the application looks and feels exactly like the design. They are skilled at using pre-built components, styling tools, and libraries to bring designs to life efficiently.

However, this developer might lack a deep understanding of how things work behind the scenes. They might be excellent at crafting user interfaces, but their knowledge often stops at implementation. They don’t necessarily dive into how the framework operates internally, and while they can create functional and attractive applications, their ability to solve complex problems or optimize performance might be limited.

### 2. The Informed Developer

The second type of frontend developer also starts by implementing designs, but with a deeper approach. This developer not only knows how to use the tools but also understands how they work under the hood. For example, if they’re using Angular, they can explain how change detection works, how the framework’s internal processes function, and how to read and comprehend the open-source code of the framework. They don't just follow best practices—they understand why they are best practices.

This deeper knowledge comes with experience and a commitment to continuous learning. The informed developer can debug complex issues, build custom solutions, and contribute to open-source projects. They often push the boundaries of what’s possible in frontend development, crafting highly optimized, maintainable, and scalable solutions.

### The Path of Seniority and Experience

Becoming the second type of developer often takes years of experience and a willingness to dive deep into the technology stack. It’s a choice each developer makes: to remain comfortable with implementation or to strive for a deeper understanding of the tools they use. Surprisingly, many developers with over five years of experience may still not fully grasp how the frameworks they work with operate internally.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, each developer chooses their path. Both types have strengths, but understanding how tools work under the hood elevates problem-solving and innovation. It’s about more than just coding—it’s about mastering your craft.
